# Deploy-boiler-plate

A simple deploy script for your full stack or backend projects.
It comes with the full script you just have to add what the few variables are pointing to.
There are only four variables and once you add your info, you are done! No hassle of writing
a deploy script this is made easy for people who would just rather have a template to add variables to.

P.s. have fun deploying your projects!
